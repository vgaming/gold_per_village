Set individual 'Gold per Village' for each side.

Remember game creation settings?:
Player1   gold: [100] income: [0]
Player2   gold: [100] income: [+1]  <-------
Player3   gold: [50] income: [0]
Player4   gold: [75] income: [0]

With this add-on enabled, income bonus +1 will not be constant.
Instead, each village of this player will provide 1 additional gold per turn.
Getting 10 villages will give 10 more gold for this player.

The idea is to give a handicap that scales with map size.
The more villages a handicaped side gets the more
income it'll have (and vice versa).


Note: this add-on has no effect if you don't set any handicaps.
