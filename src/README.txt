Set individual 'Gold per Village' for each side. Give handicap to friends-beginners (so that the game would be more challenging), or AI.

Example:
Player1   gold: [100] income: [0]
Player2   gold: [100] income: [+1]  <-------
Player4   gold: [75] income: [0]
Player3   gold: [50] income: [0]

With this add-on, _each village_ of Player2 will provide 1 additional gold per turn. (Compare this to constant +1 as per default rules.)

Because the income bonus depends on owned villages, it scales with map size (making it suitable even for large maps).

Note: this add-on has no effect if you don't set any handicaps.
