Give more/less income to friends-beginners, yourself or AI.

Example:
Player1   gold: [100] income: [0]
Player2   gold: [100] income: [+1]  <-------
Player4   gold: [75] income: [0]
Player3   gold: [50] income: [0]

With this add-on, _each village_ will give 1 more gold per turn. It thus scales with map size.

Note: this add-on has no effect if you don't set any handicaps.
